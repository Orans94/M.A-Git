1. Clone - when we clone a repository and the user decided to stash the existing repository, we also stash the WC.
           Which means that at the end of the clone process the source and the destination directories will be exactly the same.


 Note:
 loading from xml- when loading repo from xml, the location doesn't our system create it whole location but if the xml loading opreation
 canceled the new path will still be existing in the fs.



EX03:
- Usernames aren't case sensitive- the username (i.e Oran is the same as OrAN)
